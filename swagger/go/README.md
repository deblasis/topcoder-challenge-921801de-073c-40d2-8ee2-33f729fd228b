# Go API Server for swagger

The [MCRN](https://expanse.fandom.com/wiki/Martian_Congressional_Republic_Navy) wants to build and deploy new software to all their space stations spread throughout the Solar System. With the exponential increase of trade between the [OPA](https://expanse.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Planets_Alliance) and the [Earth](https://expanse.fandom.com/wiki/Earth) the legacy systems running on Martian space stations have been having difficulty directing and optimizing traffic.
